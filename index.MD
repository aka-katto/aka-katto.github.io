A less space-restrictive articulation of my resume

# About Me 

*(aka_katto vaguely means 'red cat')*

Hello prospective dandere2x user and or employment recruiter, welcome to my page! This page briefly serves as a less formal resume, where I can talk more personally about my projects (as on my resume it's rather brief).

Online I go by the handle of aka_katto for online persona reasons, but in real life I go by Tyler!

## Dandere2x

### Overview

Dandere2x is the first video compression algorithm for SRCNN (super-resolution convolutional neural network) image upscalers.  Dandere2x makes use of visual redundancies found in animation to reduce the time needed for a GPU to upscale an image, as it greatly reduces the amount of pixels needed to be processed.

### Dandere2x in Media

A fan-made german video explaining how dandere2x works and how it is used to process videos using waifu2x faster.

#### 2) [Dandere2X - 图文实战教学 - 基于Waifu2x的动漫风格视频Upscale工具的基础应用](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv2975001/)

A fan-made tutorial of how to use an older version of dandere2x in Chinese. 

### Technological Accomplishments

This is a non-exhaustive list of programming features I either developed or deployed in my project

#### 1) Multi-language project (C++ and Python)

Early on in Dandere2x development, java was deemed too slow for the costly computations for needed. Eventually the cost intensive functions were ported to C++, whose outputs are read by python for the less computationally demanding tasks. 

#### 2) Threading / Parallelism

Dandere2x uses extensive use of key modular components to run in parallel to minimize the experienced run time for the user. Each threaded class is programmed in such a way, if *killed* by the user, can be resumed in a later dandere2x session, allowing for dandere2x sessions to be suspended and resumed. 

#### 3) GUI Driven User Operation

To appeal to a more general audience, Dandere2x comes included with a GUI executable for ease of use, although users and tinkerers can still run dandere2x through a YAML driven operation.
